<l>The vice of that blood which</l>

<l>Which cries aloud wherein I tread</l>

<l>Which bear me triumphant</l>

I remember where I was only 7 seeing them weeping, and when I inquired the cause, my Brother told me that it was because they were thinking of our Saviour, and she discoursed to me on his love to children and to poor sinners in a way which made a deep impression on me. _<date><date annotationId="ent_1067" when="1778-06-02" cert="definite">June 2 1778</date> </date>my dear Mother brought me hither to <placeName>Christiansfeld</placeName> for education. I felt overjoyed on my arrival here, though I could not tell why, but I have since thanked the Lord with tears a thousand times for choosing me out of the world and bringing me to his people. I soon felt myself at home with my companions, and was very happy. The children's prayer class were days of especial blessing to my heart. <date><abbr>Febr</abbr> 16 1780 </date>I received permis=<note type="catchword">year</note></p>

I felt much on leaving the children's choir, in which I had enjoyed so much of my Saviour's nearness, where we brought him our united supplications, or when I retired to weep for him in private. <date><date annotationId="ent_1069" when="1780-07-09" cert="definite">July 9</date> </date>following, I was <abbr>rec'</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>d</abbr></hi> into the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi>; but having to wait some time for admission to the Lord's supper, I could not understand it, as I had made it a subject of frequent prayer, and hitherto the Lord had always heard me. On reflection, I said it was to teach me not to trust in my own strength, or diligence, or virtue, or good education, and to wean me from the dangerous self-complacency which I cherished on account of these things. And my faithful Saviour <sic>succeded</sic> <corr>succeeded</corr> in convincing me that I was possessed of nothing good.

In this disposition my days passed happily away, until my innate depravity began to awaken within me. Hitherto I had often acknowledged myself a sinful creature, but now I <hi rend="underline">felt</hi> that from the heart proceed wil thoughts, and sorely was I tormented with un-christianlike thoughts, so that I had no rest day nor night. To disclose my trouble to others, would I thought inevitably deprive me of their good opinion; my confidence in my Saviour also vanished, and I knew not how to bear myself for distress of mind. In this pitiable condition, I shut my- self up in a room alone - it was a sacrament-day <date><abbr>Dec</abbr> 24 1785</date>, threw myself at my Saviour's feet and<note type="catchword">begged</note>

<p>begged him with a flood of tears to have mercy on his wandering child, and give me to feel the pardon of my sins. And never shall I forget, I trust, the look of grace with which I was cheered on this occasion lay my crucified Redeemer. It was as though he said to me himself "I have heard thy prayer and seen thy tears - thou art mine." "Might all his loving heart but see, And know his bowels of compassion To sinners, straying carelessly, Or such as mourning seek salvation." From this time I was like one new-born; I felt my short-comings indeed very frequently, but the Lord inspired me with faith in Him, so that I could lay all my wants before Him. I was also enabled to speak confidentially with my choir-laborer, which was a great care to me. I now went on my course, not indeed without variation, yet always finding comfort and peace at my Saviour's feet. And his patience, mercy and compassion are<note type="catchword">more</note>

<p>more than everything to me. <date>May 4 1786</date>I was received into the <abbr>Sgle</abbr>. <abbr>Srs</abbr>. choir, on which occasion I had an inexpressibly blessed perception of the Lord's nearness, and gave myself up to him anew as his eternal property, imploring him to keep possession of my heart, that all his thoughts of peace with me might be attained. Towards the end of the same month, I had the pleasure to see my dear father here on a visit, and many a pleasing recollection of the conversation I had with him on spiritual subjects, is imprinted on my memory.<date>July 2</date>in the same year, I received a proposal to assist as teacher in the Girls' school, which caused me many heavy hours, feeling as I did my insufficiency and inexperience, and knowing that there were others more suitable for the situation. The Lord however enabled me to take the proposal as from His hand, and helped me graciously through all difficulties. It is true I had much to<note type="catchword">learn</note>

My intercourse with the dear children whom I cordially loved, and whose love I felt in return, was very pleasant to me, and the Lord was after in our midst in our social worship. When things of an unpleasant nature occurred, it was my prayer, that if I could do no good, I might at least lay no stumbling-block in the way of these little ones. _ The early part of the year<date>1789</date>was a peculiarly blessed season for my soul, my mind being much occupied with the thought of going home to the Lord. This idea was greatly strengthened, when, in the beginning of<date>April</date>I had an attack of spitting of blood. Many were the hours of blessed intercourse with the Friend of my soul, which I enjoyed at this period. Thank to Thee my faithful Saviour, for the manner</p>

<p>in which thou was pleased to own me, thy poor child: thou hast followed me with love and tender mercy from my youth up; be my confidence still, and suffer not my faith to fail, till the happy hour shall strike which summons me to meet thee, when I shall say: "Here comes a sinner who would fain <abbr>Thro</abbr>' the Lamb's ransom entrance gain."; I would rather have gone home at this time than recovered, and both mind and body felt the effects of this illness for a long period. In the following<date><abbr>Sept</abbr></date>. several things combined to weigh down my spirits, and every one thought I was in a decline. As I kept my trouble to myself, the burden was the heavier, and I began to doubt my Saviour's willingness to help. But he appeared again to comfort me and put my anxious grieving to shame. I was especially cheered at this time, by the privilege which he vouchsafed[?] me, of joining in the celebration of the<date>16 of <abbr>Sept</abbr>.</date>with the servants of our Church.<note type="catchword">Thus</note>

<p>Thus far was written <date><abbr>Nov</abbr>. 1789</date>. <date><abbr>Jany</abbr> 1 1798</date>was a very blessed New- years-day to me. The Lord gave me to feel his forgiveness of all my transgressions and mistakes so sensibly, that my heart overflowed with gratitude and joy, and I devoted myself to his service amongst the little ones with new courage, heavy as my situation had been in many respects in the past year. On the<date>12</date>I received a call to <placeName><placeName annotationId="ent_363" ref="http://geonames.org/2933921" cert="definite">Ebersdorf<precision annotationId="ent_363" precision="high"/></placeName></placeName> as Co-labourer of the <abbr>Sgle</abbr> <abbr>Srs</abbr>. choir, which, notwithstanding my insufficiency, I ventured to accept in reliance on the Lord's help, which I had experienced on many a former trial. On casting a retrospective glance on the 20 years which I have spent in this dear <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi>, I cannot but adore my Saviour with the deepest humility and gratitude for his great long-suffering, patience and faithfulness. The love and friendship testified towards me by my sisters, notwithstanding all my failings, humbled me greatly, and made the parting painful. Nor<note type="catchword">could</note>

<p>could I have the dear children committed to my care without a pang. My sincere wish is that they may all prosper for the Lord, and yield themselves to him as his property. On my dear father's happy depature at <date>Christmas 1794</date>, my dear mother removed hither to my no small gratification and joined the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi>. I had now to quit her and all my dear friends, leaving <placeName>Christansfeld</placeName> <date>May 5</date>, and on the <date>30 </date>of the same month, I arrived in <placeName>Ebersdorf</placeName>. I felt a strange sensation on catching a first view of the place in the distance, but I said "Dear Saviour, thou hast called me hither, and thou must help me. Thou best knowest my weakness, I know none here but thee alone, and thou permitted me to cling to thee." Notwithstanding my fears, I was received with much love. Previous to my being introduced to the choir, I cast myself at the feet of Jesus and besought him with many tears to be my Guide, and enable me to walk before</p>

It was as if our Saviour himself laid his pierced hands upon my head, and gave me his benediction. What rendered it still more impressive to me was, that it occurred just at the entrance upon Passion week. I soon felt at home in this dear peaceful settlement, and spent 3 years very happily. The Laborer and Warden of the choir were two old experienced sisters, whose counsel and assistance were of essential service to me. Their love, as well as the love and confidence of my sisters generally, made my abode here very pleasant.<date>March 30 1801</date>I received a call to <placeName>Fulnec</placeName>, which was again a hard trial to me. Gladly would I have declined it but I did not feel at liberty to do so. I therefore accepted it in implicit reliance on my gracious Lord.

<p>I sink down abased before my Lord and Saviour, for numberless proofs of his love, faithfulness and forbearance, which I have experienced in many ways. The first year I spent here appeared very heavy indeed; everything seem'd so different to what I was accustomed, and not knowing the language, was altogether a heavy task. However my best Friend did not leave me nor forsake me, but lent a gracious ear to all my wants and complaints. In <date><abbr>Oct</abbr>. 1802 </date>I was afflicted with an epidemical fever, and so ill, that little hope was given of my recovery. Though I had no clearness that I should go to my dear Saviour, yet I wished for that favor to see him face to face, and felt happy in the thought of leaving this world. But it pleased him to restore me again, and I found much reason to thank and adore him for his paternal love and care, which was made manifest to me.<date><abbr>Dec</abbr>. 15</date>the same year we celebrated the anniversary of this house</p>

This surely was a day which the Lord himself made; the blessings we enjoyed will always be remembered with gratitude by those who were present; and I can truly say it was the first day I felt quite at home here. In<date>1803</date>and<date>1804</date>it pleased our Saviour to call home to himself both my fellow-labourers. This was a heavy stroke, which was very severely felt by me: but thanks to my dear Lord, who supported me, as I now in a way felt as standing by myself. The love and support and confidence, which I under these afflictions experienced from my dear choir, will never be forgotten by me. Sinner-tears bedew my cheek now while I write these lines, and call to mind numberless proofs of my Redeemer's love and patience towards me, the poorest of the needy; which my</p>

<p>It was only on the<date>22</date>of last month that our dear sister was taken ill, having probably caught cold on the preceding day where she was walking in the burial- ground lane. She was soon obliged to keep her bed, though no immediate apprehensions were entertained as to the result. After a whole week however had elapsed, the unabated continuance of the febrile symptoms, and the total loss of appetite occasioned by<note type="catchword">the</note>

<p>the malady, filled our minds with anxiety, and she herself began to entertain the hope that her Saviour was about to call her to himself. On the<date>2</date>of this month, she quoted the well-known lines of <persName><persName annotationId="ent_365" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Wesley" cert="definite" type="real">C. Wesley</persName></persName>: _ "O could I catch a smile from thee And drop into eternity."</p>

<p>She said she should be glad to go to him if it were his pleasure. In reply to a remark made on the loss which we should feel if she were removed from us, she disclaimed all idea of worthiness in herself; her short-comings she said, were many, and she had nothing to trust to but our Saviour's merits. On the following day though very weak so that she had not spoken all the morning, she rallied a little when <persName><abbr>Br</abbr>. Edwards</persName> called in the afternoon, and uttered a few broken sentences, the purport of which was, that she longed to go home soon to be with the Lord.<note type="catchword">The</note>

<p>The farewell blessing in reference to her departure, was now given, and her dear bought soul recommended to the hands of her Redeemer, who had led her so graciously throughout her course, and made her so rich a means of blessing to others. She was again favored with an interval of consciousness on the 6th (Saturday last) and requested her <sic>visiter</sic> <corr>visitor</corr> to pray with her. From that time she gradually sunk away, until on<date>Monday the 8</date>it pleased the Lord to release her from her worn-out tabernacle in a very gentle manner, and translate her who the presence of his glory with exceeding joy _ Her age was 78 3/4 years.

<p>deeply intrusted in the welfare of the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> collectively and individually. Consecrated to the Lord from early infancy, she spent a long life in fellowship of spirit with her Saviour, and accounted it a privilege to serve him with all the power and faculties which he had given her. What above all distinguished her character and made her so eminently useful in his church, was the large measure of the spirit of love, which was poured out upon her. Her service as choir-laborer in <placeName>Ebersdorf</placeName>, <placeName>Fulnec</placeName> and <placeName>Gracehill</placeName>, will long be treasured in the recollection of those who were favored to enjoy her kind and faithful care. By far the greater portion of her life has been dedicated to active service in the family of Christ below. Not to mention her services as Teacher for 11 1/2 years, her labors in her own choir comprise a period of 48 years from her entrance<note type="catchword">on</note>

It may be truly said of her, that it was her greatest happiness to do good, and the manner in which she performed her deeds of kindness, made them still more valuable. Humility, indeed, was likewise a very leading feature in her character, and nothing would have distressed her more than the thought of being made the subject of eulogy. Still, it is meet to acknowledge the grace of God and the unfeigned faith which dwelt in her so much, and to set before our minds for invitation, the humility, simplicity and love, which graced her walk and conversation, as she went in and out amongst us. We may still admit to her sincere and steady love for the Lord's house and ordinances. His place in Church was never vacant, when she was able to venture out; and to stay<note type="catchword">away</note>
